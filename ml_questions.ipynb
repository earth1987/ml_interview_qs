He knows that is contains one of the two types of candy: cholate or milk. Without taking a bite, there is no way to tell whether a candy is milk or chocolate. However, having devoured candy for years, sweet-toothed Shane has internalized a way to differentiate between these candy types just by looking at its size and shape. Shane's technique can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities in the following way.**"
